- `@zudojs/schema`: new `isSchemaValidationError(error)` guard narrows a caught error so `error.issues` is typed `readonly SchemaIssue[]` without a cast (it also checks each issue's shape at runtime). `parse()` and `unwrapSchemaResult()` now throw `SchemaError<SchemaIssue>`.
- `@zudojs/errors`: `SchemaError` is generic (`SchemaError<TIssue = unknown>`, likewise `SchemaErrorOptions` and `createSchemaError`); the default keeps existing code unchanged.
- `@zudojs/schema`, `@zudojs/validation`: length and count messages use the singular for one ("at least 1 character", "at least 1 item") instead of "1 characters".
- `@zudojs/types`: new `formatCount(count, singular, plural?)`.
- `@zudojs/logger`: the console transport prints the formatted line instead of a record object that repeated the timestamp and level; an `Error` passed as the second argument of a level method (`logger.error("failed", err)`, common in JavaScript) is now logged as the entry's error with its stack instead of being read as empty metadata and dropped (the typed form remains `logger.log(level, message, { error, metadata })`); no trailing space before a stack trace. The `Logger` interface is unchanged.
