Cache and database correctness fixes.

- `CacheService.invalidateByPattern` now awaits the tag purge it triggers, matching `clear()`. With an asynchronous tag store (a shared, Redis-backed one, for example) the tag-to-key mappings for the invalidated keys are now guaranteed to be gone by the time the call resolves, and a failure from the tag store is reported to the caller — or swallowed under `failSilently` — instead of escaping as an unhandled rejection that would terminate the process.
- `toPrismaInclude` now validates one include level per frame, so its depth bound actually applies to the nested tree. A deeply nested `include` is refused with the documented `RangeError: Relation include depth exceeds the maximum of N` rather than overflowing the stack.
- `toPrismaInclude` no longer treats a relation or `select` field whose name happens to be an `Object.prototype` member (`toString`, `valueOf`, `constructor`, `__proto__`, …) as a duplicate or silently drops it. Such names are now handled as ordinary keys.
- `getOrSet` in the database cache no longer poisons a key permanently when the loader throws synchronously rather than returning a rejected promise. The failed load is evicted from the in-flight map and the next call invokes the loader again, as it already did for asynchronous failures.
