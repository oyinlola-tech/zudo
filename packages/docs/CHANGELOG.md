Development toolchain updated to Vitest 5.0.1 and @types/node 26.6.2; no runtime changes.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Tooling correctness fixes for the testing, docs, adapters, feature-flag and CLI packages.

  - `createStub()` now returns the same no-op function for a given property on every access, so `stub.handler === stub.handler`. A `bus.on("x", stub.handler)` / `bus.off("x", stub.handler)` pair written against a stub now actually removes the listener instead of leaking it between tests.
  - `InMemoryTestStorage.set(key, value, 0)` now treats a zero TTL as a deadline of "now" — the entry is already expired on the next read. Only an omitted TTL means "never expires". A test that wrote `0` to mean "already stale" previously got an entry that never expired.
  - `generateMarkdown` now HTML-escapes the deprecation blockquote (`deprecatedMessage`) and the `**Owner:**` line, as every other text position it writes already did. A document built from untrusted JSON can no longer put raw `<script>`/`<img>` tags into generated markdown that a renderer with HTML enabled would execute.
  - `AdapterRegistry.healthAll()` no longer loses an adapter named `__proto__`: the per-adapter report is built on a null-prototype object, so the entry is present, the aggregate status reflects it, and nothing writes through to `Object.prototype`. `AdapterRegistry.register()` now refuses the names `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype` with an `AdapterConfigurationError`.
  - `AdapterOperationOptions.retry` is now implemented rather than merely declared. `healthAll({ retry: { attempts, delay } })` re-runs a check that reports `unhealthy` up to `attempts` times in total, pausing `delay` ms between tries; `timeout` still bounds each try and an aborted signal stops the retries immediately. Without `retry` the behaviour is unchanged (one try).
  - `valuesEqual` now compares structurally instead of by `JSON.stringify`: key order no longer matters, a key whose value is `undefined` is no longer equal to an absent key, arrays compare element-wise, `Date`s compare by instant, `NaN` equals `NaN`, and a self-referencing value is compared rather than throwing a `TypeError` out of a function typed to return a boolean.
  - `FeatureFlags.snapshot()` and `getAll()` now reject with `FeatureFlagProviderError` when the flags were never loaded, instead of resolving to an empty result that is indistinguishable from "no flags are configured". Once a load has succeeded they keep serving that data even if a later reload fails, and a provider that genuinely holds no flags still resolves empty. `evaluate()` is unchanged and still reports `reason: "error"`.
  - New `providerCooloffMs` option (default 5,000 ms; `0` restores the old behaviour) leaves a failing flag provider alone for that window instead of re-running `getAll()` and `get(key)` on every single evaluation during an outage. A successful call closes the window immediately and `refresh()` always probes.
  - `CLIParser({ stopAtFirstArgument: true })` no longer reports the first positional token as the command. The token now appears only in `args`; previously it appeared in both `commands`/`command` and `args`.

- Updated dependencies [`c904687`, `c904687`]:
  - @zudojs/errors@1.2.0

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Round 10 audit fixes.

  - `stripMarkdown` runs in linear time; 2 KB of newlines used to block for ~6 s (tooling/DOCS-01).
  - `validateLinks` scans in linear time; a 99 KB document used to take ~30 s under the 100 KB scan cap (tooling/DOCS-02).
  - Frontmatter `tags` always parses to a string array (`tags: http` → `["http"]`, `tags:` → `[]`, `tags: [a, b]` → `["a", "b"]`); `createDocument` no longer spreads a string tag into characters. Empty arrays/objects serialize as `[]`/`{}` and round-trip (tooling/DOCS-03).
  - Structured-node markdown generation HTML-escapes text (`&`, `<`, `>`) outside code blocks and writes links whose scheme is not http, https, mailto, tel, ftp or ftps as plain text; `validateLinks`/`validateAll` report such links as `UNSAFE_LINK` errors (tooling/DOCS-04).
  - Visibility filtering fails closed: only an unset or exactly `"CLIENT"` visibility reaches the `"CLIENT"` filter and `generateIndex`; every other value (e.g. `"server"`) is treated as server-only (tooling/DOCS-05).
  - `parseFrontmatter` removes only the single blank separator line after the block, keeping body indentation and further blank lines; numeric literals become numbers only when the conversion is lossless (`1e+21` and `1.5e-7` round-trip, `007` stays a string) (tooling/DOCS-06).

  Behaviour changes: structured paragraphs/tables/quotes/lists/headings are HTML-escaped; `javascript:`/`data:` links become plain text and fail validation; `getAll({ visibility: "SERVER" })` also returns documents with unrecognised visibility; frontmatter bodies are no longer left-trimmed.

- Updated dependencies [`d2b01bf`]:
  - @zudojs/errors@1.1.0

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- - `nodesToMarkdown` no longer resolves an unknown callout `kind` such as `"constructor"` through `Object.prototype`; the label is the upper-cased kind instead of a function's source text.
  - `deepFreezeClone` (and therefore `createDocument` and the registry) no longer freezes the caller's nested objects in place when the value cannot be structured-cloned; the fallback now copies plain objects, arrays and Dates recursively.
  - `validateNavigation` reports `NAVIGATION_DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT` when the same navigation node object is mounted in more than one place.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`16f14c3`](https://github.com/oyinlola-tech/zudo/commit/16f14c36d05f664d914bc6e1b9de70f67ff55860) Thanks [@oyinlola-tech](https://github.com/oyinlola-tech)! - BREAKING CHANGE: Rename all packages from `@zudojs/*` to `@zudojs/*` and `@zudojs/cli` to `zudojs-cli`.

  - Scoped packages: `@zudojs/adapters`, `@zudojs/api`, `@zudojs/auth`, etc.
  - CLI package: `zudojs-cli` (unscoped)
  - All internal imports, docs, CI, and examples updated

  Migration:

  ```bash
  # Old
  npm install @zudojs/cli
  npm install @zudojs/errors

  # New
  npm install zudojs-cli
  npm install @zudojs/errors
  ```
